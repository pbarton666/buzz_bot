This dir has all the html to server the main part of the PES site, which has static content,
from port 80.  The intereactive, Djano-enabled piece will be served separately (as a frame
within the main site) from a another port.

This might be funky, but it's the solution I came up with to have Django work and play will
with a frame-oriented environment.  OK.  Why a frame-oriented environment?  Because I want
causal visitors to the site to be able to pull up Buzz crawler results to see that we're
doing something in this area (hence need access to dynamic content).  

There's probably a better way, but this works.
